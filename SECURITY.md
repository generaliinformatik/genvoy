## Reporting Security Issues

The Generali OST takes security bugs in the toolkit seriously. We appreciate your
efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to
acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, email
[opensource.de@generali.com](mailto:opensource.de@generali.com?subject=SECURITY) and include the
word "SECURITY" in the subject line.

The Generali OST will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your
report. After the initial reply to your report, the team will keep you informed
of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional
information or guidance.
